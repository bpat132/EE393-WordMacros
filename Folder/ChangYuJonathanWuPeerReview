Suggestions
=======

You should consider adding comments to your macro. This should include your (author) name. 

The macro should be cleaned up. Your uploaded version contains defunct macros. I have deleted them.

--------------------------------

Although some old macros have been added back in, you should still determine which ones are needed and which ones aren't. 
I belive there are redundant macros.
